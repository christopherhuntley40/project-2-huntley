Trifilar Pendulum Lab

Kispert:
This looked really good overall.  Everything was included and ran as expected.  The only thing I noticed seemed to be an issue was usage of subscripts in the actual report.  A block equation of math code uses curly brackets to specify when more than one character is in the same subscript. Besides that one change I couldn't find anything else to edit or add.  Good work.
